<h1>What does the right to a speedy trial really mean?</h1>

<ul>
	<li> The right to a speedy trial protects a citizen from undue delays in the judicial system. While This guarantees the citizen will be notified or indicted within 30 days of the arrest and the trial must begin within 70 day of indictment or arraignment. If this right is violated the trail is dismissed with prejudice.
