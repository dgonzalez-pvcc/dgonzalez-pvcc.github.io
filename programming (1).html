<h1>Phases of Computer program development</h1>
<img src = !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ul>
	<li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
	<li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
	<li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
	<li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
	<li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
	<li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
	<li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programming Structures</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li> 
	<li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
	<li>Iterative (Looping):
			while looping: continue looping as long as something is true
			repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true
			for loop: loop a given number of times</li> 
	<li>Recursive structures:
			Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
			<li>Repitition continues until:
				degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met
				(degenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
</ul>
<h3>Two classic programming/database problems<h3>
<ul>
			<li>Sorting numbers</li>
			<li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
		<li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
			<li> In database:
				Filters: temporary search
				Queries: search criteria are saved so they dont have to be recreated</li>
		<li>Two popular search techniques:
			Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time
			Binary search: only works if data is SORTED first, start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
</ul>	
	<h3>Two classic program goals<h3>
<ul>
			<li>Effiiciency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources
			Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
</ul>
