<h1>Network Classifications</h1>

<ul>
	<li>LAN: Refers to computers in a single building or complex./li>
	<li>MAN: Same as LAN except used to reference a larger network in a community./li>
	<li>WAN: A connection spanning across cities or even the globe. /li>
</ul>

<h2>Network Models </h2>

<ul>
	<li> Bus Network: All machines are connected to one communication line.</li> 
	<li> Star Network: A wireless form of network where communication is done through radio broadcast to a central machine.</li>
</ul

<h3>Protocols<h3>

<ul>
	<li>CSMA/CD Ethernet: Communication protocol that states all machines monitor messages but only keep those addressing it.</li>
	<li>CSMA/CA Wifi: Communication protocol which focuses on avoiding collisions of information to a bus. If a collision occurs data is retransmitted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combining Networks<h3>

<ul>
	<li> Repeater: Connects two existing networks passing data back and forth without considering meaning.</li>
	<li> Bridge: Connects two networks on a bus but considers the destination of data and only distributes when addressed to a network.</li>
	<li> Switch: The same as a Bridge but connects multiple networks.</li>
	<li> Router: Special purpose computers used for forwarding messages that forms an internet between networks. Unique from previous entires becasue it allows connected networks to remain independent.</li>
	<li> Gateway: The point at which a network is connected to the internet. In most cases the router or WIFI networks are considered the gateway to the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Client/Server Model<h4>

	<li> P2P: Peer-to-Peer: Provides service to each other, an example being instant messaging.</li>
	<li> Distributed System: Software units that execute as processes on different computers</li>
	<li> Cloud Computing; Huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Internet Addressing<h5>

	<li> Tier 1: The "backbone" of the internet. High-speed and capacity international WANS operated by large companies.</li>
	<li> TIer 2: Connected to Tier 1 ISPs. Regional adn less powerful. Operated by companies.</li>
	<li> Tier 3: Independent internet sometimes referred to as "intranet" operated by single authority that is the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.</li>
</ul>

<h6>IP Adderss<h5> 

	<li> ICANN: Non-profit corporation established to coordinate the INternets operation.</li>
		<a href = "https://www.icann.org/">
	<li> DNS: Internet wide directory system made of name servers</li>
	<li> TLD or Top Level Domain: Examples being .edu .com and .gov</li>
	<li> Country-Code TLDS: Examples beign .va .ca .eu</li>
		<a href = "https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/">
</ul>

<h7>Internet Protocols<h7>

	<li>FTP: Application for accessing antoehr computer from a great distance.</li>
	<li>HTTP: Handles webpages.</li> 
	<li>SMTP: Defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.</li>
</ul>

<h8>World Wide Web<h8>

	<li>URL: The unique address given to each document that provides the information neeeded by a browser to contact the proper server adn request the desired document.</li>
	<li>Client-Side activities: Activitites performed by the client.</li>
	<li>Server-Side activities: Activities performed by the server.</li>
</ul>

<h9>Internet Four-Layer Software<h9>

	<li>Application Layer: Consisting of clients and servers that use the interent communication to carry out tasks.</li>
	<li>Transport Layer: Used by the application layer to send and recieve messages over the interenet.</li>
	<li>Network Layer: Recieves packages of data from the transport layer and decides where they need to be sent.</li>
	<li>Link Layer: In charge of sending and recieving packets.</li>
</ul>

<h10> Internet IS: <h10>

	<li>Packet-Switching Network: Digital data is sent by breaking teh data into blocks of bits called packets. Contains the data being transmitted and control information for sending the data.</li>
	<li>Fault Tolerant: </li>
	<li>Redundant: </li>
</ul>

<h11>CyberSecurtiy<h11>

	<li>Malware: General term to describe malicious software.</li>
	<li>Virus: Software that infects computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.</li>
	<li>Worm: Autonumous program that transfers itself through a network and can forward copies of itself to other computers.</li>
	<li>Trojan Horse: Enters computer disguised as desireable program.</li>
	<li>Spyware: Software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides adn reports that data back to the instigator of the atttack.</li>
	<li>Phishing: Technique of sniffing out data by simply asking for it.</li>
	<li>DDOS Attack: Process of overloading a computer with information</li>
</ul>

<h12>Protection<h12>

	<li>Firewall: Filters traffic passign through a point in the network usually at the gateway in an effort to fend off malicious software.</li>
	<li>Spam Filter: Variation of a Firewall that monitors email.</li>
	<li>Proxy Server: Acts as intermediary between client and server with the goal of sheilding the client from adverse actions fo the server.</li>
	<li>Antivirus Software: Used to detect and remove the presence of recorded malicious software.</li>
	<li>Cryptography: The study of sending and recieving messages securly.</li>
	<li>Public Key Encryption: A method of encryption in which the data can pass to whoever has the public key but access can only be obtained with the private key.</li>
</ul>
